# AA-Reboot Applet

NOTE: THIS REQUIRES THE AA-REBOOT NRO FILE IN ORDER TO WORK AND A LINKED/FAKELINKED USER

It replaces the 0100000000001010 Applet using LayerdFS to start the AA-Reboot.nro  at sdmc:/switch/AA-Reboot.nro. 

0100000000001010 is the "Nintendo Switch Online Applet" on the homescreen but keep in mind it also replaces the LoginApplet, the ShareApplet and the LobbyApplet.

The Loginapplet is inaccessible in CFW because the Nintendo servers are blocked.
The Shareapplet is accessible but can't be used because you can't post pictures because the Nintendo servers are blocked.

Tip: If you have only user on your switch, you can select "Skip Selection Screen" in the system settings to start aa-reboot instantly!
